This solution(CheckoutSolution) contains two projects, one is MS Test project showing test cases for checkout kata
and the other project ie CheckoutService which is class library that holds the implementation of checkout class.

All the changes added to the project are incremental which can be seen by the git commit history. Tried to have as many as logical commits
with meaningful description.
